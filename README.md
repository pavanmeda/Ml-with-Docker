# Ml-with-Docker
To develop a simple Ml application,containerize it using docker and deploying it Github.
Steps need to follow starts from building model and deployment in github in ubuntu includes many steps:
•	Overview of the project
The Project overview is to develop a simple machine learning application, containerize it using Docker, and deploy it on GitHub. This exercise will help you understand the principles of containerization, version control, and basic machine learning application development.

•	Instructions to build and run the Docker container
1.Install Docker Engine using the following command:
sudo apt update sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io 
2.	Set Up the Docker Repository
3.Create a Dockerfile for the ML Application
4.Develop the Machine Learning Application
5.Build and Run the Docker Container



•	Instructions to test the ML endpoint
6.Test the ML Endpoint
7.Deploy the Application to GitHub
•	Any other relevant information about the project.
This project Gives a clear idea of how to deploy an ML application in the github.
Thedataset we used in this project is simple inbuilt Iris dataset.So Need to download any dataset from the external source.Scikit library automatically reads the dataset.
